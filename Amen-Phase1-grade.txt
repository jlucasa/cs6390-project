TEAM NAME: Persuasian Extraction
TEAM MEMBERS: Jared Amen 
TASK: Extraction and Classification of Persuasive Phrases

System Design: A
Evaluation: NONE
Demonstration: A
Report: A
---------------
OVERALL: B (85)


Strengths

* you successfully got the basic infrastructure set up and an LSTM
  trained for this task, which is a strong baseline model.

* well-written report. 

Weaknesses

* There was no evaluation of the results at all. Please make this a
  PRIORITY for Phase 2! You should aim to compute recall, precision,
  and F score for each class label, as well as an average F score over
  the classes. 

Feedback

* As we discussed earlier, I think it would simplify things to focus
  on only a subset of the class labels, probably the most frequent
  classes seen in the data set (i.e., ignore labels for classes that
  were only seen, say, less than 10 times in the data set, or
  something like that. But this is up to you. 

* You should decide whether you want to focus on the full multi-label
  task or whether it might be sufficient to assume just one label per
  token. If you decide to stick with multi-label, then your Phase 2
  model should be able to produce multiple labels per token. 

* For the Phase 2 demonstration, please plan to show your system's
  output as full phrases, not token-level BIO labels.  This will be
  much more readable and intuitive output (e.g., "what about the
  mayor?" --> WHATABOUTISM) [I just made up this example, not sure
  it's a good one. ;)]
